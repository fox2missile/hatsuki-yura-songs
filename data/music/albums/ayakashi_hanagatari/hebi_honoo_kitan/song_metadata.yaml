  青い夕闇に 遠く幻消える
  約束した日は 遠い夏の月

  橋を渡り 鬼ノ手 七つ願いを掛けて
  狂い咲いた夢

  届け 届け 嗚呼 恋の焔
  心を燃やして 辿り着け
  涙 唇 きらきらと 『あなただけくだしゃんせ』

  散らせ 散らせ 嗚呼 恋の花を
  私 忘れた 恋人に
  光る瞳はきらきらと 愛しあなた 求め続ける

  濡れた黒椿 揺れる面影ひとつ
  そっと千切っては 紡ぐ数え歌

  映し鏡 鬼ノ眼 七つ呪い掛けて
  狂い咲いた夢

  届け 届け 嗚呼 恋の焔
  蛇身果てても 辿り着け
  白い指先 きらきらと 『あなただけくだしゃんせ』

  散らせ 散らせ 嗚呼 恋の花を
  誓い 破った 恋人に
  光る瞳はきらきらと 愛しあなた 求め続ける

  燃ゆる鐘 道行き地獄
  絡み合い 二人堕ちけり 蛇の道哉

  届け 届け 嗚呼 恋の焔
  蛇身燃やして 何処までも
  赤い唇 ひらひらと 『あなただけくだしゃんせ』

  散らせ 散らせ 嗚呼 恋の花よ
  すべて 奪って 命まで
  光る瞳はきらきらと 恋し憎し 愛し続け

      In the blue twilight, my dream, vanished far away.
      The promise I made, that day, is from a distant summer month.

      The demon's way crosses over the bridge, holding seven desires.
      A crazy dream bloomed...

      Receive, receive, ah, this flame of love,
      I will reach you with my heart ablaze 
      Tears, lips, sparkling, "My blessing is only for you!".

      Scatter, scatter, ah, this flower of love,
      To the lover I have forgotten
      My shining eyes are glittering and keeping asking, my beloved one!

      The wet black camellia, swung one face,
      Softly broken into pieces, to spin a counting song.

      The demon's eyes reflect in the mirror, holding seven curse.
      A crazy dream bloomed...

      Receive, receive, ah, this flame of love,
      Even if my snake's body perishes, I follow the way and I will reach you
      My white fingertip glitters to say: "My blessing is only for you!"

      Scatter, scatter, ah, this flower of love,
      To the lover who broke our promise
      My shining eyes are glittering and keeping asking, my beloved one!

      The burning bell goes down the road of hell...
      Entwined with you, my journey caused together our loss...

      Receive, receive, ah, this flame of love,
      Even if my snake's body burns everywhere...
      My red lips flicker to say: "My blessing is only for you!"

      Scatter, scatter, ah, my flower of love,
      Everything is snatched away, even my life...
      My shining eyes are glittering to keeping loving and hating, my beloved one!

      The lover was not lost, but rather the Snake Princess was betrayed.

      The title of song should refers to a princess youkai snake (hebi), which has the power of fire.
      With this power she can do flames and control the fire. The title can be translated by "flames snake" or "fire snake."
      The reason, the snake has gone in hell, is because she was thinking she can resist to the flames of hell, and see her lover once more.
      But according the song, more she is going deeply in hell, more she finished to be burned, until to die.

      こちらはアップテンポで煌びやかな曲でございまする。
      苑子ちゃんの歌詞が儚げ可愛くて「あなただけくだしゃんせ」の部分に
      きゅんきゅんしました。女性の良い感じの狂い具合がこれまた秀逸。

          Now, an upbeat tempo and a flamboyant song.
          The lyrics from Ms. Sonoko are very cute and have been accentuated by emotions, on the part: "All my blessings only to you!"
          This feeling of madness from the woman is also excellent, here.

      A female youkai snake (hebi) has promised to see her lover, a long time ago.
      The truth of the song is probably a forbidden love between a human and a youkai.
      In the song, there is no doubt that the human is dead. But the youkai is alive in reason of her long lifetime.
      But, this princess snake has her heart broken, and can't live without him, anymore.
      So, she will go in a long journey, and her journey will lead her in Hell.
      All along the song, she follow the way of hell, in hoping to see her lover, once again.
      But all her body will finish to be burned by the flames of Hell, until to die.
      A very sad song with a crazy determination, a cute love, and a sad tragedy.
      She finished to be burned by the flames of her love.
